# Music / ambiance

Depending on the dryness value of the current tile (src/game/generator.ts), a mix of the song "At The Shore" and the clip seaambiance.mp3 should play. Both should repeat indefinitely, and seaambiance should be louder when the player is standing at lower dryness values. At The Shore should fade in as the players move towards higher dryness values.
